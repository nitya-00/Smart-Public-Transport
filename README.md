# Smart-Public-Transport
# Problem Statement -
Commuters face uncertainty, overcrowding, and long wait times

No real-time data on bus location, delays, or seat availability

Transport authorities lack tools to monitor and improve services

Routes and schedules don’t adapt to changing demand

Tier 2 & 3 cities are equally affected — with higher growth & limited infrastructure
# Our Solution-

1. Commuter-Facing Mobile App
Live Bus Tracking:  See exact location, ETA (based on real-time traffic + delays).


Capacity Updates: Know if the bus is full, standing only, or has available seats.


2. Transport Authority Dashboard
Real-Time Bus View: Location, route, crowding, timing for every bus.


Demand Heatmaps: Identify high-traffic stops and peak hours.



3. Two-Way Feedback System
In-App Ratings: Passengers report issues (e.g., crowding, cleanliness, behavior).


AI Feedback Analysis: Detect patterns in complaints to improve service quality.


4. AI & Deep Learning Applications
ETA Predictions: Smarter arrival times using past delays, traffic, weather.


Crowding Alerts: Estimate passenger load via sensors or cameras.

# Tech Stack- 

Frontend: Flutter / React Native

Backend: FastAPI + Streamlit dashboard (previously considered Node.js / Flask)

Database: Firebase / MongoDB (bus locations, logs, feedback)

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch / Hugging Face for prediction & feedback analysis

Deployment: Cloud platforms like AWS / Vercel / Heroku
